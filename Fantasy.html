													[Kid Cudi]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

Not for nothing I've forseen it, I dream it
I can feel it slowly dripping away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

[Kanye West - Verse 1]
Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
and eventually answers to the call of Autumn
all of them fallin' for the love of ballin'
got caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums
based off the way we was branded
face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
and at the airport they check all through my bag and tell me that it's random
but we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
and a new fitted and some job opportunities thats lucrative

This the real world, homie, school finished
they done stole your dreams, you dunno who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won't be satisfied til all my niggas get it, get it?

[Kid Cudi]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

[Kanye West - Verse 2]
Is hip hop just a euphemism for a new religion
the soul music for the slaves that the youth is missing
this is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
as long as I'm in Polo's smilin they think they got me
but they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me

I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me
if a nigga aint shootin a jump shot running a track meet
but this pimp is, at the top of mount Olympus
ready for the World's game, this is my Olympics
we make 'em say ho cause the game is so pimpish
choke a southpark writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up offa this dick
and these drugs, niggas cant resist it
remind me of when they tried to have Ali enlisted
if I ever one of the greatest nigga, I must have missed it!

[Kid Cudi]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

[Kanye West - Verse 3]
I need more drinks and less lights
and that American Apparal girl in just tights
she told the director she tryna get in a school
he said "take them glasses off and get in the pool"
it's been a while since I watched the tube
cause like a crip said: "I got way too many blues for any more bad news"
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
they rewrite history I don't believe in yesterday
and what's a black beetle anyway, a fucking roach
I guess thats why they got me sitting in fucking coach
but God said I need a different approach
cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffing coke
its not funny anymore try different jokes
tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, x and o
kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I'm got it
play strings for the dramatic
and end all of that wack shit
act like I aint had a belt in two classes
I aint got it I'm comin after whoever who has it
I'm coming after whoever who has it
you blowing up, that's good, fantastic
that y'all, its like that ya'll
I don't really give a fuck about it at all
cause the same people that tried to black ball me
forgot about 2 things, my black balls

[Kid Cudi - Chorus]

[Raekwon]
I know cops, hems is lifting lenses
kid, Armani suits, fresh fruits, Bally boots and Benzes
counting up, smoking, one cuff
live as a red Jag, a Louis bag, grabbing a blunt, fuck it
steam about a hundred and one L's
kites off the jails, buying sweats, running up in Stetson
nigga hat game was special
it matched every black pair of Nikes
throwing dice for decimals
the older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head
make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead
got made code red
break up the black skunk
the black dutch, back of the old shed
if you can't live, you dying
you give or buy in
keep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding
keep shining, to every young man, this is a plan
learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye

[Kid Cudi]
Not for nothing I've forseen it, I dream it
I can feel it slowly dripping away from me
no more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

								(Oh hey Oh hey Oh hey
Hey Hey)

I'm living in the 21st century doin' something mean to it
Do it better then anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the haters, got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his theme music

[Chorus:]
No one man should have all that power
The clocks tickin' I just count the hours
Stop trippin' I'm tripping off the power
(21st century Schizoid Man)

The system broken, the school's closed, the prison's open
We ain't got nothing to lose motherfucker we rollin',
Huh? motherfucker we rollin'
With some light skinned girls and some Kelly Rowland's
In this white man's world we the ones chosen
So goodnight cruel world I'll see you in the mornin',
Huh? I see you in the mornin'
This is way too much, I need a moment.

[Chorus:]
No one man should have all that power
The clocks tickin' I just count the hours
Stop trippin' I'm tripping off the power
Till then, fuck that the world's ours
(21st Century Schizoid Man)

Fuck SNL and the whole cast
Tell them Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
More specifically they can kiss my ass hole
I'm an asshole? You niggas got jokes!
You short minded niggas thoughts is Napoleon
My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in
I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He knows, he's so fuckin' gifted
I just needed time alone, with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind but couldn't open up my own vault
My child-like creativity, purity and honesty is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catching up with me, taking my inner child I'm fighting for custody
With these responsibilities that they entrust in me
As I look down at my diamond encrusted piece thinking...

[Chorus:]
No one man should have all that power
The clocks tickin' I just count the hours
Stop trippin' I'm tripping off the powder
Till then, fuck that the world's ours
(21st Century Schizoid Man)

Colin Powell, Austin Powers
Lost in translation with a whole fuckin' nation
They say I was the abomination of Obama's nation
Well that's a pretty bad way to start a conversation
At the end of the day goddamn it I'm killin' this shit
I know damn well ya'll feelin' this shit
I don't need your pussy, bitch I'm on my own dick
I ain't got a power trip who you going home with?
How 'Ye doin'? I'm Surviving
I was drinkin' earlier now I'm driving
Where the bad bitches huh? Where ya hidin'?
I got the power make your life so excitin'...

(Oh hey Oh hey Oh hey
Hey Hey)

Now this'll be a beautiful death
[Dwele:]
I'm jumping out the window
I'm Letting everything go
I'm Letting everything go
[x3]

You got the power to let power go flow

[Ad-lib]

Something wrong
I hold my head
MJ gone, our nigga dead!
I slapped my girl, she called the feds
I did that time and spent that bread
I’m heading home, I’m almost there
I’m on my way heading up the stairs
To my surprise a nigga replacing me
I had to take 'em to that ghetto university

[Chorus]
All of the lights
Cop lights, flash lights, spot lights
Strobe lights, street lights
All of the lights
All of the lights
Fast life, drug life
Thug life, rock life
Every night

Restraining order
Can’t see my daughter
Her mother, brother, grandmother hate me in that order
Public visitation
We met at Borders
Told her she take me back
I’ll be more supportive
I made mistakes
I bump my head
Courts suck me dry
I spent that bread
She need a daddy
Baby please, can’t let her grow up in that ghetto university

[Chorus]

Cop lights, flash lights, spot lights
Strobe lights, street lights
All of the lights
All of the lights
Fast life, drug life
